Flutainer is an open source client for Portainer that lets you monitor and control Docker containers from mobile and desktop.

Features:
- register multiple Portainer endpoints via API keys stored with secure storage when available
- browse environments and filter containers by name
- start, stop, pause, and unpause containers with busy state feedback and optional auto refresh
- view container logs with streaming updates plus sharing/export
- light and dark themes, localized UI (EN, IT, ES, DE, PT)

Data stays between you and the Portainer endpoints you configure. Flutainer does not include analytics or third party trackers.
